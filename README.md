# VOTARIC

This is a Decentralized Autonomous Organization that gives members the right to vote for what they want and need in the community.

A community Driven Project, the members are the voice and majority carries the vote, as all data is being stored on the BlockChain it leaves the door open to transparency.

## Note:

This is a demo project i made to practice my Blockchain development skills and also for the Encode and Polygon Hackathon with other organizations like Unstoppable domains and Covalent.

### Covalent API

On the Application users are given a dashboard where they can see their Token balance and NFT balance if available, this was made posiible by using [Covalent API](https://www.covalenthq.com/) Endpoint for getting token balances.
